about_content: |
  I'm a computer geek with a knack for problem solving.

  Very interested in UX with years of experience with **angular** and **Vue**, and some experience with **React**.

  In the backend most of my experience is in **.Net** and **java**, and lately I've been working with **nodejs**.
   
  **Linux** power user ever since I discovered Open Source in college. I try to give back to the OS community as much as I can. Defender of good practices and **agile** methodologies. I learned **functional programming** by tinkering with lisp while learning to use Emacs.
